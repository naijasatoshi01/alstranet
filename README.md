## Introduction

**AlstraNet** is a comprehensive Business Process Management (BPM) solution designed to seamlessly integrate with EVM-compatible blockchains. This README provides an overview of the AlstraNet project, including its objectives, architecture, key functions, security measures, deployment, and more.

## Overview

AlstraNet provides a unified and innovative approach to BPM by combining both on-chain (Layer 1 or L1) and off-chain (Layer 2 or L2) components. It is designed to meet the evolving needs of modern businesses by offering a secure, scalable, and private platform.

## Objectives

The primary objectives of AlstraNet are as follows:
- Create a scalable BPM solution that ensures data security and privacy.
- Seamlessly integrate BPM contracts within the Layer 2 (L2) environment.
- Provide a reliable platform for a wide range of BPM-related functions.

## Architecture

### Components

AlstraNet's architecture comprises the following key components:
- On-Chain (Layer 1) Contracts: These contracts form the foundation of data availability, decentralization, and data integrity.
- Off-Chain (Layer 2) Environment: This environment includes Sequencers, Executors, Provers, a Validator Network, and Relayers, which work together to optimize BPM transaction processing and ensure data privacy.

### On-Chain (Layer 1) Contracts

On-chain contracts in AlstraNet are responsible for critical functions such as data availability, decentralization, verification, data integrity, and interoperability between Layer 2 and other components.

### Off-Chain (Layer 2) Environment

The off-chain environment in AlstraNet includes Sequencers, Executors, Provers, a Validator Network, and Relayers, all of which collaborate to optimize BPM transaction processing and ensure data privacy.

### BPM Contracts

All BPM contracts are exclusively deployed and executed within the Layer 2 environment (Executor) of AlstraNet, streamlining BPM processes, ensuring efficiency, and providing data privacy.
